## Dataset Preparation
Follow the instructions in https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/tree/master/data/oscar to download oscar-en full dataset. Note that the dataset takes around 550G of disk space. This dataset is used for training LLaMA & LLaMA 2.
### Dataset Preparation Example
The below provides the steps required to prepare your dataset. It is based on instructions in https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/tree/master/data/oscar.  The dataset in the example is intended to be `zh`
### Step 0 :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience.git
cd bigscience/data/oscar
# Edit the `oscar-to-jsonl.py` in the list language_subsets and remove the comment on unshuffled_deduplicated_zh and comment out unshuffled_deduplicated_en
vi oscar-to-jsonl.py
```
### Step 1 :
```bash
# -s can be added for subset of data
$PYTHON oscar-to-jsonl.py
```
### Step 2 :
  ```bash
mkdir -p zh
mv oscar*.jsonl zh
cd zh
  ```
### Step 3 :
Use one of the three methods below to tokenize the dataset. You can use any number of workers based on the CPU cores.
*  Tokenize the dataset using GPT2BPETokenizer:
    ```bash
    # download gpt2 vocab and merge files
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/gpt2-vocab.json
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/gpt2-merges.txt

    # tokenize individual jsonl files
    # loop count will change based on number of files for a given dataset
    mkdir zh_tokenized
    for i in $(seq 0 4);
    do
      $PYTHON $MEGATRON_DEEPSPEED_ROOT/tools/preprocess_data.py --input oscar-${i}.jsonl --output-prefix zh_tokenized/tokenized${i} --tokenizer-type GPT2BPETokenizer --vocab-file gpt2-vocab.json --merge-file gpt2-merges.txt --append-eod --workers 80
    done
    ```
  * Tokenize the dataset using GPTSentencePieceTokenizer:
    ```bash
    # download tokenizer.model based on model trying to train
    # tokenize individual jsonl files
    # loop count will change based on number of files for a given dataset
    mkdir zh_tokenized
    for i in $(seq 0 4);
    do
      $PYTHON $MEGATRON_DEEPSPEED_ROOT/tools/preprocess_data.py --input oscar-${i}.jsonl --output-prefix zh_tokenized/tokenized${i} --tokenizer-type GPTSentencePieceTokenizer --tokenizer-model /path/to/tokenizer.model --append-eod --workers 80
    done
    ```

  * Tokenize the dataset using HFTokenizer:
    ```bash
    # path to tokenizer can be local directory path and to run custom code from it, trust remote code option(--trust-remote-code) should be passed
    #  or
    # path to tokenizer can be link to huggingface repo model card
    # if huggingface repo model card is a gated repo, Log in using a token from huggingface.co/settings/tokens with below command
    # huggingface-cli login
    # --seq-length value need to be passed explicitly from huggingface repo model card or local directory path which has model_max_length in tokenizer_config.json file

    # tokenize individual jsonl files
    # loop count will change based on number of files for a given dataset
    mkdir zh_tokenized
    for i in $(seq 0 4);
    do
      $PYTHON $MEGATRON_DEEPSPEED_ROOT/tools/preprocess_data.py --input oscar-${i}.jsonl --output-prefix zh_tokenized/tokenized${i} --tokenizer-type HFTokenizer --tokenizer-model /path/to/tokenizer --append-eod --workers 4 --seq-length 1000000000000000019884624838656
    done
    ```
### Step 4 :
 * Multiple tokenized dataset files are merged into a single file using the below method:
    ```bash
    # merge tokenized files
    mkdir zh_tokenized_merged
    $PYTHON $MEGATRON_DEEPSPEED_ROOT/tools/merge_datasets.py --input zh_tokenized --output-prefix zh_tokenized_merged/tokenized_text_document
    # use the tokenized files generated from above command to train
    ```

# Training Script Settings
* Based on the tokenization method, update the tokenizer type:
  ```
  HL_TOKENIZER_TYPE=GPT2BPETokenizer
  ```
* To run custom tokenizer code from local path using HFTokenizer method:
  ```
  HL_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE=1
  ```
* Update data root dir with the path of your choice:
  ```
  HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT=/data/bigscience/oscar-en
  ```
* Update data file prefix(*.bin and *.idx) based on file name in data root dir:
  ```
  HL_DATA_FILE_PREFIX=tokenized_text_document
  ```
* Update tokenizer.model file path if it is not in data root dir, required for any sentence piece based tokenizer:
  ```
  HL_TOKENIZER_MODEL=path/to/tokenizer.model
  ```

Note: For the training commands, make sure to change the IP addresses in hostsfile according to your setup.
`HL_RESULTS_DIR` and `HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT` must be shared writable across all nodes and launchers when running training on more than 8 cards.
The same applies to `HL_CHECKPOINTS_DIR`, `HL_TENSORBOARD_DIR` and `HL_KILL_SWITCH` if specified.
If `HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT` is not writable, then `HL_DATA_CACHE_DIR` must be set to a writable location and
must be shared and accessible across all nodes and launchers when running training on more than 8 cards.


# LLaMA Training and Examples
* Training of LLaMA is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971
* Training of LLaMA 2 is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288

## Multi-Card Training Examples
* Run LLaMA 2 13B on 8 HPUs with BF16 precision:
  ```
  HL_NUM_NODES=1 HL_PP=2 HL_TP=2 HL_DP=2 scripts/run_llama.sh
  ```

* Run LLaMA 2 13B on 64 HPUs with BF16 precision:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=scripts/hostsfile HL_NUM_NODES=8 HL_PP=2 HL_TP=2 HL_DP=16 scripts/run_llama.sh
  ```

* Run LLaMA 2 70B on 32 HPUs with BF16 precision:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=scripts/hostsfile HL_LLAMA_MODEL_SIZE=70 HL_NUM_NODES=4 HL_PP=4 HL_TP=8 HL_DP=1 scripts/run_llama.sh
  ```

LLaMA 2 training supports FP8 precision, which improves model performance. To enable FP8, set `HL_USE_TRANSFORMER_ENGINE=1`. Several FP8 parameters adjust model performance, accuracy, and memory utilization. It is not recommended to change the following default parameters, as they are set optimally:
 - `HL_FP8_FORMAT=hybrid`
 - `HL_FP8_MARGIN=0`
 - `HL_FP8_AMAX_RECOMPUTE_ALGO=max`
 - `HL_FP8_AMAX_REDUCE=1`
 - `HL_FP8_MEASURE_INTERVAL=GBS/micro_batch_size/DP`
 - `HL_FP8_AMAX_HISTORY_LEN=GBS/micro_batch_size/DP`

The below parameter can be added to improve model performance while using FP8. Try adding them if you have enough memory:
 - `HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT_FWD=1`
 - `HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT=1`

* Run LLaMA 2 70B on 32 HPUs with FP8 precision:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=scripts/hostsfile HL_LLAMA_MODEL_SIZE=70 HL_NUM_NODES=4 HL_PP=4 HL_TP=8 HL_DP=1 HL_CKP_ACT=0 HL_SEQ_LEN=4096 HL_MICRO_BATCH=1 HL_USE_TRANSFORMER_ENGINE=1 HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT_FWD=1 scripts/run_llama.sh
  ```

* Run LLaMA 2 13B on 16 HPUs with FP8 precision:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=scripts/hostsfile HL_NUM_NODES=2 HL_PP=2 HL_TP=2 HL_DP=4 HL_CKP_ACT=2 HL_SEQ_LEN=4096 HL_ZERO_STAGE=1 HL_USE_FAST_SOFTMAX=1 HL_MICRO_BATCH=2 HL_GRAD_ACCUM_DTYPE=bf16 HL_USE_TRANSFORMER_ENGINE=1 HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT_FWD=1 HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT=1 scripts/run_llama.sh
  ```

* Run LLaMA 2 7B on 8 HPUs with FP8 precision:
  ```
  HL_LLAMA_MODEL_SIZE=7 HL_NUM_NODES=1 HL_PP=1 HL_TP=1 HL_DP=8 HL_CKP_ACT=2 HL_SEQ_LEN=4096 HL_ZERO_STAGE=1 HL_USE_FAST_SOFTMAX=1 HL_MICRO_BATCH=1 HL_GRAD_ACCUM_DTYPE=bf16  HL_USE_TRANSFORMER_ENGINE=1 HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT_FWD=1 HL_USE_CACHE_FP8_WEIGHT=1 scripts/run_llama.sh

# Mixtral Training and Examples
* Training of Mixtral is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088

## Multi-Card Training Examples
Configure the following for the Mixtral examples below:
* Set the correct path for `HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT`.
* Set the correct values for `HL_TOKENIZER_TYPE` and `HL_DATA_FILE_PREFIX`.
* Add `HL_DATA_CACHE_DIR` and/or `HL_TOKENIZER_MODEL` if necessary.

Refer to [training script settings](#training-script-settings) for details.

In addition, Capacity Bins functionality was introduced for Mixtral. Capacity bins is
a solution for more performance efficent handling of dynamicity in Mixture of Expert layer.
Expert capacity values are limited to a fixed set of values (defined by bins).
Bins are auto-optimized in given steps intervals, based previous bins usage frequencies.

Capacity bins are configured using following variables:
* `HL_MOE_NUM_CAPACITY_BINS` - Number of bins to be used.
* `HL_CAPACITY_BINS_EXP_BASE` - Exponential base for initialization of capacity bins.
Bins are generated with exponential growing bins width.
Bins that are closer to the start are smaller and thus have less extra non-required capacity.
* `HL_MOE_CAPACITY_BINS_ALIGNMENT` - Every capacity bin value (initialized or optimized)
will be a multiple of this alignment.
* `HL_MOE_CAPACITY_BINS_OPTIMIZE_INTERVAL` - Steps interval for auto-optimization of MoE capacity bins.
* `HL_MOE_CAPACITY_BINS_OPTIMIZE_MAX_GROUP` - Maximum group size of adjacent MoE gates
that their capacity bins are optimized jointly.

Capacity bins functionality is enabled by setting `HL_MOE_NUM_CAPACITY_BINS`.
Recomended configuration is to set `HL_MOE_NUM_CAPACITY_BINS=10`
and leave other parameters as default values.

* Run Mixtral 8x7b on 32 HPUs, Lazy mode, with BF16 precision, sequence length 32k:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=$MEGATRON_DEEPSPEED_ROOT/scripts/hostsfile \
  HL_MOE_NUM_CAPACITY_BINS=10 \
  HL_NUM_NODES=4 \
  HL_TP=8 \
  HL_MOE_EP=1 \
  HL_SEQ_PARALLEL=1 \
  HL_MOE_ENABLE_EXPERT_TP=1 \
  HL_ZERO_STAGE=1 \
  HL_CKP_ACT=1 \
  $MEGATRON_DEEPSPEED_ROOT/scripts/run_mixtral.sh
  ```
